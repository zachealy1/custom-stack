# Custom Stack Implementation

This project is a Java-based custom stack implementation with various functionalities. The main focus is developing stack data structures with different configurations and testing their behaviour through a command-line interface.

**This work was completed as a part of my undergraduate degree in Applied Software Engineering at Swansea, which CGI Inc. sponsored.**

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key components:

- **Main.java**: The main entry point to run the application. It provides a command-line interface to interact with and test stack functionalities.
- **Stack.java**: A custom stack implementation with core stack operations such as `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and other helper methods.
- **StackTwo.java**: A second variation of the stack implementation, possibly with different features or optimised for specific use cases.

## Features

- **Custom Stack Operations**: Provides the basic operations of a stack (e.g., push, pop, peek).
- **Multiple Stack Implementations**: Includes `Stack.java` and `StackTwo.java`, allowing comparison and testing of different stack implementations.
- **Console Interaction**: Users can interact with the stack implementations through the console.
